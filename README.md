# Project One: Dusted

#### Game Overview

Dusted is a Space Invaders inspired game. The aim is to shoot or 'dust' as many vampires as possile whilst dodging the hearts that randomly being thrown. In order to win the player must dust all the vampires before they reach the bottom on the grid. The player has three lives for every heart that hits the player a life is lost. The player can dodge the hearts by hiding behind a grave but once the graves are hit the hearts once they disappear making it more challenging for the player to dodge them.

### Challenges 

### Process

This game was the first I had ever created indepndantly because of this I it was important to spend the first day writing out a plan. This invovled thinking through alls the aspect of the game and what it would require to create all of these elements.<br>

After this I started with the basics that I would need the HTMl and CSS elements: creating the grid, buttons, and CSS that would highlight the elements a little more easily. Then I moved onto simply getting the gun, graves, vampires onto the screen and moved onto the functionality of getting them to move. This was my approach to every aspect of the game - grab the item needed, think and write out how I would approach getting the functionality to work for it and work through any issues that arose. 

### Wins 

### Reflection 

Selecting a Space Invaders type of game seemed like the logical option for me; this game allowed me to work on my array methods, objects and DOM manipulation.
